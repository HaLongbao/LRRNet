# It’s Not the Target, It’s the Background: Rethinking Infrared Small Target Detection via Deep Patch-Free Low-Rank Representations

This is the official repository for our paper, and we will open-source the code once the paper is accepted.

Comparison of the proposed LRRNet with existing data-driven methods.
This design is based on **a key insight**: the low-rank nature of infrared images implies an inherent compressibility---when the rank is sufficiently small, the image information can be sparsely encoded while being nearly ''losslessly'' preserved.
